# My Golang Project

## Introduction

This is a sample Golang project that demonstrates how to use the `net/http` module to create an HTTP server. The server outputs a string that includes an environment variable value.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `go run main.go` to start the server
3. Visit `http://localhost:8080` in your web browser to see the output

By default, the environment variable value is empty. To set a value for the environment variable, use the following command:

```bash
export environment=my_environment
